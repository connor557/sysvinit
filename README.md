# sysvinit

System V style init programs original written by Miquel van Smoorenburg that control the booting and shutdown of your system. It is commonly used by GNU/Linux operating systems and is licensed under the GNU General Public License, version 2 or later.

This project is a development fork of the official upstream (https://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/sysvinit), presented on GitHub for easier access and visibility. As changes here are tested and polished, they will be moved back upstream and made part of future stable releases.

Update: The contents of this repository have all been merged back into the official upstream SysV init repository on Savannah. This repo should not be usd for new development as the latest source code for init can be found here: https://savannah.nongnu.org/git/?group=sysvinit

Support for this project in the form of patches and bug reports is welcome. People wishing to financially support SysV init development can do so through PayPal (by sending donations to jsmith@resonatingmedia.com) and through Patreon (https://www.patreon.com/sysvinit).
