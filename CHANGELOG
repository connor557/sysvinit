    * The pidof command used to discover the correct PID of
    a process even if the wrong path was given. For example
    pidof /wrongpath/sleep would find the PID of a command run as "sleep".
    This bug was reported on Launchpad for Ubuntu and on Savannah.

    This bug appears to have been fixed in the development branch,
    allowing these bugs to be tested/closed.


    * Confirmed Savannah bug #37114 (mountpoint does not detect
    mount points using --bind on same file system) still exists,
    but fixed in Debian and Red Hat. 
    Considering this bug closed since distributions are using
    util-linux's mountpoint program and ours is no longer
    built/used by default.
    Considered importing util-linux mountpoint but that would duplicate
    effort and pull in a new dependency on libmount.


    * Problem with pidof breaks after prelink (Savannah bug #34992)
    fixed. Patch supplied by Dave Dykstra.

    * Patch to automatically spawn agetty on kernel consoles
    The feature is useful for developers and admins that occasionally need
    to boot with e.g. console=ttyS0.
    The built in default can be overridden via inittab for each device. An
    entry like "S0::off:" turns off the getty on ttyS0.

    * Imported patches from Arch Linux's bootlogd to avoid special
    characters in log file. Also makes parsing easier.
    This should close Savannah bug report 36528.

    * Applied patches provided in Savannah bug report 49991. Fix tabs in
    bootlogd and avoid printing unitialized "buf" variable when
    consolename() fails.
