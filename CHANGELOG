    * Added Patch from Debian developer Mats Erik Andersson to make
    ioctl work on GNU/kFreeBSD. Patches bootlogd.

    * Added Robert Millan's Debian patch to set TERM variable to xterm (instead
    of cons25) when running on GNU/kFreeBSD.

    * Added Robert Millan's Debian patch to use /run/initctl as the named
    pipe for communicating. This works around a limitation on the kFreeBSD
    branch which prevents us from using /dev/initctl for pipes.

    * Confirmed we have applied Guillem Jover's patch to make
    ifdown work on FreeBSD.

    * Confirmed we have Debian patch to fix enabling SELinux.

    * Confirmed we have Debian patch to make sure utf-8 flag is not cleared from tty.

    * Confirmed we have Roger Leigh's Makefile patch to allow building
    with multiarch libcrypt.

    * Applied Justus Winter's symlink patch to make sure killall5
    builds and runs on Hurd.

    * Confirmed we have Werner Fink's PATH_MAX patch for getting
    killall5 to build on Hurd.

    * Made sure we have Petter Reinholdtsen's patch to init.c which
    allows init to build on GNU/kFreeBSD despite missing VSWTC.

    * Dropping Debian patch to use /run/nologin instead of /etc/nologin in paths.h.
    Seems every distribution uses a different location. Oracle uses /etc/nologin,
    CentOS seems to use /var/run/nologin.
    We will use /etc/nologin and let distros patch to suit their own preference.

    * Updated halt.8 man page with corrections from
    Christoph Anton Mitterer.

    * Confirme we have applied patch from Bjarni Ingi Gislason
    which fixes typo in fstab-decode man page.

    * Applied Debian patch to allow init to build on GNU Hurd.

    * Confirmed we have Debian patch from developer Johannes Truschnigg
    which informs the user of field size limit.

    * Applied patch from Debian to the init manual page (init.8)
    to better address runlevels. (Author unknown)

    * The pidof command used to discover the correct PID of
    a process even if the wrong path was given. For example
    pidof /wrongpath/sleep would find the PID of a command run as "sleep".
    This bug was reported on Launchpad for Ubuntu and on Savannah.
    https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/sysvinit/+bug/1546126
    http://savannah.nongnu.org/bugs/?47196
    This bug appears to have been fixed in the development branch,
    allowing these bugs to be tested/closed.


    * Confirmed Savannah bug #37114 (mountpoint does not detect
    mount points using --bind on same file system) still exists,
    but fixed in Debian and Red Hat. 
    Considering this bug closed since distributions are using
    util-linux's mountpoint program and ours is no longer
    built/used by default.
    Considered importing util-linux mountpoint but that would duplicate
    effort and pull in a new dependency on libmount.


    * Problem with pidof breaks after prelink (Savannah bug #34992)
    fixed. Patch supplied by Dave Dykstra.

    * Patch to automatically spawn agetty on kernel consoles
    The feature is useful for developers and admins that occasionally need
    to boot with e.g. console=ttyS0.
    The built in default can be overridden via inittab for each device. An
    entry like "S0::off:" turns off the getty on ttyS0.

    * Imported patches from Arch Linux's bootlogd to avoid special
    characters in log file. Also makes parsing easier.
    This should close Savannah bug report 36528.
    http://savannah.nongnu.org/bugs/?36528

    * Applied patches provided in Savannah bug report 49991. Fix tabs in
    bootlogd and avoid printing unitialized "buf" variable when
    consolename() fails.
